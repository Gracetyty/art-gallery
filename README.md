# art-gallery
As the outbreak of Covid-19, many schools and educational institutions have moved their platforms from the real classrooms to virtual ones. In the Intro- duction Digital Humanities class, we have learned different digital tools and various methods on how to analyze data. It is obvious that digitalization has been reshaping many dimensions of our life. More and more educational in- stitutions, museums and businesses will be presented on the Internet. How technology transforms real life? There are no definite answers, but I think there are some ways to find inspiration through doing some practical things. Therefore, I combine art gallery with Internet to envision a possible virtual art classroom from enjoying a virtual gallery. The whole responsive website is named ”Art Gallery”: 4 web pages: index(homepage,introduction, art history and art gallery).The website is mainly used for art class and some more contents are needed to be updated as long as it will be used as an educational digital resource. At the moment, it is a trial website but it contains basic components an art class requires: multimedia, exploration, gallery viewing.
